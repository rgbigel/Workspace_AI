## 1. Governance Rules

### RULE-REV-001: Mandatory Review-Gated Commits & Invariant Review Boundary
1. **Mandatory Visual Review Gate**: Every Git commit action for source code, configuration, tools, modules, or structural assets (`*.ps1`, `*.psm1`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.lcm/*`, `docs/*`) in any LCM-governed repository requires a prior validated review disposition (`ACCEPTED` or `ACCEPTED_WITH_EDITS`) produced via the formal Beyond Compare 5 visual review gate (`Invoke-BeyondCompareReview.ps1`).
2. **Conversational Directives Do Not Waive Gating**: Explicit user instructions in chat (e.g. "yes, remove that", "fix this error") grant authority to execute file edits and staging, but **DO NOT waive the Beyond Compare visual review gate**. The agent `MUST` launch `Invoke-BeyondCompareReview.ps1` and await user review sign-off / folder clearance before executing `git commit` and `git push`.
3. **Exemption Scope**: Only purely mechanical telemetry artifacts defined in `RULE-EFF-001` (`inventory.json`, `INVENTORY_DASHBOARD.md`, `out/test_results.json`, and activity logs) are exempt from visual review gating.

### RULE-REV-002: Accepted with Edits Qualification
When a review outcome is recorded as `Accepted with Edits` (or `Accepted with Change`):
1. The modified codebase `MUST` execute and satisfy all repository quality gates (`Test-RepoReadiness.ps1`).
2. The modifications `MUST NOT` introduce rule violations, regression errors, or broken dependencies.
3. Upon satisfying all quality gates, the state `SHALL` be classified as fully `ACCEPTED` and committed to Git.

### RULE-REV-003: Override & Force Authority for Rejected/Deferred States
If a review outcome is `REJECTED` or `DEFERRED`:
1. Automated commit and push pipelines `MUST` halt immediately.
2. Committing or pushing changes in a rejected or deferred state `IS FORBIDDEN` unless explicitly commanded by the user with a forced override instruction (e.g., `-Force` parameter or unambiguous explicit override prompt).

### RULE-REV-004: Precedence Over General Permission Rules
The review-gating rules (`RULE-REV-001` through `RULE-REV-003`) take strict precedence over any general "all commands are permitted" or automated background execution policies in effect across the workspace.

### RULE-REV-005: Universal Audit & Change Request Traceability
Every review disposition (`Accepted`, `AcceptedWithEdits`, `Rejected`, `Deferred`) `MUST` be recorded with an immutable timestamp, reviewer identity, repository HEAD SHA, and notes into:
1. `Workspace_Inventory/logs/cm_activity.log` (Append-only CM audit ledger).
2. `Workspace_Inventory/data/reviews/REVIEW-<Repo>-<Timestamp>.json` (Structured review evidence).
3. The active Change Request (CR) record in `Workspace_Inventory/data/change_requests.json` and mirrored proposal Markdown files when modifying governed baselines.

### RULE-REV-006: Mandatory Review Stop & Turn Termination Invariant
1. **Mandatory Turn Termination**: Whenever an agent carries out a CRP or code modification reaching the visual review stage, the agent `MUST` launch `Invoke-BeyondCompareReview.ps1` and **immediately terminate the current response turn without making additional tool calls**.
2. **Prohibition of Same-Turn Submissions**: The agent `MUST NOT` invoke `Submit-ReviewResult.ps1`, stage files, or execute `git commit` within the same execution turn cycle as the review launcher.
3. **Discrete Operator Disposition Requirement**: Review dispositions (`ACCEPTED`, `ACCEPTED_WITH_EDITS`, `REJECTED`, `DEFERRED`) `SHALL ONLY` be consumed and processed when received as a discrete, independent message submitted by the operator in a subsequent turn.

### RULE-REV-007: Mandatory Automatic Semantic Version Increment per Change Invariant
1. **Universal Version Increment Invariant**: Every change, proposal, or bug fix committed to any LCM-governed repository `MUST` increment that repository's semantic version before or during review commit:
   - **Patch Increment (`+0.0.1`)**: Standard default for all bug fixes, refinements, single-purpose enhancements, and incremental proposal completions.
   - **Minor Increment (`+0.1.0`)**: For substantive new feature sets, new tools, new sub-frameworks, or major multi-component proposals.
   - **Major Increment (`+1.0.0`)**: For global platform architectural transitions, governed by `RULE-DOC-005`.
2. **Synchronized Artifact Updates**:
   - The incremented version `MUST` be updated in:
     - DOX metadata headers of modified scripts and modules (`Version: M.Y.Z`).
     - Tripartite specifications (`Architecture.md`, `Requirements.md`, `Implementation.md`).
     - Top-level `README.md` and repository manifests.
     - `Workspace_Inventory/data/inventory.json` repository record.
   - Commit messages and review receipts `MUST` record the resulting semantic version (e.g. `feat(cm): ... [v7.1.1]`).
