## 1. Governance Rules

### RULE-REV-001: Mandatory Review-Gated Commits & Gate 2 Non-Circumvention Invariant
1. **Mandatory Visual Review Gate (Gate 2)**: Every Git commit action for source code, configuration, tools, modules, or structural assets (`*.ps1`, `*.psm1`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.lcm/*`, `docs/*`) in any LCM-governed repository requires a prior validated review disposition (`COMPLETED` or `COMPLETED_WITH_EDITS`) produced via the formal Beyond Compare 5 visual review gate (`Invoke-BeyondCompareReview.ps1`), with transparent junction traversal via `FollowSymLinks` (`RULE-REV-008`).
2. **Strict Gate 2 Non-Circumvention Baseline**: Beyond Compare visual diff review is non-circumventable for code/tools/specs across all items by default. Even critical, urgent, or internally generated BUGs normally execute in `DOIT` mode (`always-proceed = $true`) without a Gate 1 planning pause, but halt at Gate 2 for operator review before reaching `COMMITTED`.
3. **Authorized Exceptions to Gating**:
   There are two (2) authorized exceptions to this rule:
   1. **Explicit Operator Directive (`IMMEDIATELY`, `FORCE`)**: The user can explicitly INSTRUCT (`IMMEDIATELY`, `FORCE`) to bypass review confirmation and advance directly into the Implementation Phase / review commit without confirming the visual review.
   2. **Critical Flow-Impeding BUG & Loop Breaker**: The system has detected a BUG that impedes the intended flow in a critical manner, especially when the task would lead to an unavoidable loop or recursion that the user cannot circumvent or fix. In this scenario, the system may proceed autonomously, engaging `-MinimalTests` to prevent cascading test recursions, but there `MUST BE NO MORE THAN TWO (2) ATTEMPTS` to resolve the issue before halting.
   - **Mandatory Audit Logging Invariant**: In either exception case, the fact, rationale, and specific trigger `MUST` be explicitly documented in the accompanying `BUG` or `CRP` proposal bundle and recorded in the Configuration Management ledger.
   - **Quality Gate, Syntax & Language Non-Bypass Invariant**: Taking an authorized exception to bypass manual visual review strictly waives only the interactive visual diff inspection step. It `MUST NEVER` bypass, waive, or relax syntax validation (PowerShell AST parser checks, Python compilation), language rules ([`LanguagePolicy.md`](file:///d:/Git_Repositories/.agents/rules/LanguagePolicy.md) English invariant), or baseline repository readiness quality gates (`Test-RepoReadiness.ps1`). All modified files `MUST` compile cleanly with zero syntax errors and satisfy all language and formatting invariants prior to commit.
4. **Exemption Scope**: Only purely mechanical telemetry artifacts defined in `RULE-EFF-001` (`inventory.json`, `INVENTORY_DASHBOARD.md`, `out/test_results.json`, and activity logs) are exempt from visual review gating.
5. **BCompare Materiality Authority**: Beyond Compare is the sole authority for whether a difference is material. The review launcher MUST enable its insignificant-difference controls, and post-review staging MUST record only explicit operator selections made in the visual session. Raw-byte, Git-diff, line-ending, or whitespace comparisons MUST NOT create review candidates or obstruct review disposition.
6. **Non-Interactive / Headless Environment Fallback**: If Beyond Compare 5 or Session 1 interactive GUI execution is physically unavailable (e.g. running inside a headless CI/CD runner, container, or non-GUI remote SSH terminal), the agent `SHALL` present unified console diffs alongside the proposal's `Walkthrough.md` verification evidence for explicit terminal disposition before committing.

### RULE-REV-002: Completed with Edits Qualification
When a review outcome is recorded as `Completed with Edits` (or `Completed with Change`):
1. The modified codebase `MUST` execute and satisfy all repository quality gates (`Test-RepoReadiness.ps1`).
2. The modifications `MUST NOT` introduce rule violations, regression errors, or broken dependencies.
3. Upon satisfying all quality gates, the state `SHALL` be classified as fully `COMPLETED` and committed to Git.
4. When `-MinimalTests` is engaged under operator instruction or automated loop circumvention, the readiness gate executes fast-tier syntax and structure validation while bypassing heavy integration cascades; the resulting commit is recorded as `completed [minimal-tests]` with `"test_scope": "minimal"` per `RULE-LCM-023`.

### RULE-REV-003: Override & Force Authority for Rejected/Deferred States
If a review outcome is `REJECTED` or `DEFERRED`:
1. Automated commit and push pipelines `MUST` halt immediately.
2. Committing or pushing changes in a rejected or deferred state `IS FORBIDDEN` unless explicitly commanded by the user with a forced override instruction (e.g., `-Force` parameter or unambiguous explicit override prompt).

### RULE-REV-004: Precedence Over General Permission Rules
The review-gating rules (`RULE-REV-001` through `RULE-REV-003`) take strict precedence over any general "all commands are permitted" or automated background execution policies in effect across the workspace.

### RULE-REV-005: Universal Audit & Change Request Traceability
Every review disposition (`Completed`, `CompletedWithEdits`, `Rejected`, `Deferred`) `MUST` be recorded with an immutable timestamp, reviewer identity, repository HEAD SHA, and notes into:
1. `LCM_Inventory/logs/cm_activity.log` (Append-only CM audit ledger).
2. `LCM_Inventory/data/reviews/REVIEW-<Repo>-<Timestamp>.json` (Structured review evidence).
3. The active Change Request (CR) record in `LCM_Inventory/data/change_requests.json` and mirrored proposal Markdown files when modifying governed baselines.

### RULE-REV-006: Mandatory Review Stop & Lifecycle Step Invariant
1. **Mandatory Review Stop**: Whenever an agent carries out a CRP or code modification reaching the visual review stage (Gate 2), the agent `MUST` launch `Invoke-BeyondCompareReview.ps1` and **immediately terminate the current response turn without making additional tool calls**.
2. **`Proceed` at Gate 2**: Upon operator submission of **`Proceed`** (or `Proceed <ID>`) after review inspection:
   - The proposal advances by exactly one status pulse: `REVIEW` $\rightarrow$ **`COMMITTED`**.
   - The local Git commit is created with the required SemVer increment per `RULE-REV-007`.
3. **`PUSH` (Publication Trigger)**:
   - `PUSH` is the only lifecycle command that may invoke a remote push.
   - It pushes only a fully preflighted cohort of `COMPLETED` proposals and `LCM_Inventory` in lockstep.
   - Uncommitted proposals remain strictly in their local state.
   - Enforces the Push Auto-Reset Invariant: both `LCM Mode` and `Testing Mode` unconditionally revert to `ON`.

### RULE-REV-007: Mandatory Automatic Semantic Version Increment per Change Invariant
1. **Universal Version Increment Invariant**: Every change, proposal, or bug fix committed to any LCM-governed repository `MUST` increment that repository's semantic version before or during review commit:
   - **Patch Increment (`+0.0.1`)**: Standard default for all bug fixes, refinements, single-purpose enhancements, and incremental proposal completions.
   - **Minor Increment (`+0.1.0`)**: For substantive new feature sets, new tools, new sub-frameworks, or major multi-component proposals.
   - **Major Increment (`+1.0.0`)**: For global platform architectural transitions, governed by `RULE-DOC-005`.
2. **Synchronized Artifact Updates**:
   - The incremented version `MUST` be updated in:
     - DOX metadata headers of modified scripts and modules (`Version: M.Y.Z`).
     - Tripartite specifications (`Architecture.md`, `Requirements.md`, `Implementation.md`).
     - Top-level `README.md` and repository manifests.
     - `LCM_Inventory/data/inventory.json` repository record.
   - Commit messages and review receipts `MUST` record the resulting semantic version (e.g. `feat(cm): ... [v7.1.1]`).
3. **LCM_Inventory Operational Data Exemption**:
   - Routine data accounting mutations within `LCM_Inventory` (specifically `data/inventory.json`, `data/proposals/proposals.json`, `logs/cm_activity.log`, `docs/INVENTORY_DASHBOARD.md`, and `data/reviews/*`) occurring as a standard byproduct of reviews, audits, proposal lifecycle transitions, or push recording `SHALL NOT` increment `LCM_Inventory`'s semantic version.
   - Semantic version increments for `LCM_Inventory` apply strictly when source code (`tools/*.ps1`, `modules/*.psm1`), specifications (`docs/*.md`), or governance policies are modified.

### RULE-REV-008: Transparent Single-Session Directory Junction Review (FollowSymLinks)
1. **Transparent Directory Junction Traversal**: Beyond Compare 5 review sessions `MUST` configure `<FollowSymLinks Value="True"/>` in `BCSessions.xml`, enabling Beyond Compare to traverse NTFS directory junctions (such as `.agents\rules`) inline within the primary review session.
2. **Unified Single-Window Invariant**: Dual-session Beyond Compare review dispatch is retired. All repository review comparisons execute in a single Beyond Compare window without opening a separate junction review instance.
3. **Composite Local Baseline Identity**: The left pane `MUST` be exported from the target repository's explicitly resolved local `BaseCommit`; it `MUST NOT` implicitly resolve, fetch, or substitute a remote reference. Where that commit exposes a junction-backed path, the scratch tree `MUST` replace the junction with a committed rules snapshot selected in this order: the target `BaseCommit`; the local committed junction-authority snapshot at or immediately before the target commit timestamp; the nearest target-history ancestor whose Git tree contains the junction path; then the local committed `HEAD` of the live junction authority. The selected source repository, relative path, SHA, and selection source `MUST` be recorded alongside the target SHA. A target-history snapshot that predates the target commit by a later authority snapshot `MUST NOT` be selected.
4. **Historical Junction Semantics**: The baseline `MUST` contain only files present in the selected committed rules snapshot. A file visible through the live junction but absent from every available committed snapshot `MUST` remain absent on the left and appear as a live-only addition on the right; the launcher `MUST NOT copy` mutable working-tree authority content into a historical baseline.
5. **Identity and Cache Clarity**: The baseline cache identity and pane title `MUST` display the target local SHA, selected rules source, and selected rules SHA. A launcher `MUST NOT` invent or fall back to an unrelated version label when a real version artifact is unavailable.
6. **Exclusion Filter Alignment**: Review exclusion filter lists `MUST NOT` filter out `-.agents\rules\`, ensuring all governance rule diffs remain directly inspectable in the primary review pane.

### RULE-REV-009: Review Discovery Disclosure and Durable Governance Closure
1. **Operator Visibility**: When an agent discovers that a review defect, tool repair, or validation result changes the durable review contract, it `MUST` tell the operator before claiming the implementation is complete. The disclosure `MUST` distinguish the implemented code change from the pending governance or documentation change.
2. **Same-Change-Set Policy Update**: Where the finding defines a recurring review behavior, the agent `MUST` update this policy in the same governed change set, including the exact invariant, evidence fields, and required tool behavior. A tool-only repair is incomplete until this policy update is present or the operator explicitly defers it.
3. **Synchronized Discovery Surface**: Any update under this rule `MUST` synchronize the root `AGENTS.md` rule index and `LCM_AI/docs/LCM-Rules-Cross-Reference.md` under `RULE-AUTH-002`.

---

### RULE-REV-010: Zero-Assumption Pre-Review Gate Verification Invariant
1. **Mandatory Mechanical Verification Before Review**: Before any proposal or change set is presented for Gate 2 visual review or commit gating, all modified or created files `MUST` have undergone mandatory mechanical syntax parsing (PowerShell AST parser, Python compile, JSON validation) and unit test execution (Pester).
2. **Prohibition of Unverified Readiness Claims**: An AI agent or developer `MUST NEVER` launch a Beyond Compare review session, claim review readiness, or solicit operator review disposition based on visual inspection alone without prior execution evidence recorded in `Walkthrough.md`.

### RULE-REV-011: ADMINMODE Rule-Change Authorization Invariant
1. **Authorization Source**: Rule changes require `ADMINMODE = true` for the current Windows user. Eligibility is membership in the Windows local Administrators group identified by SID `S-1-5-32-544`, independent of whether the current process is elevated.
2. **Hidden Operational State**: ADMINMODE state is not displayed by standard dashboards. It initializes on workspace open to `true` for an eligible user and `false` otherwise. `Make-Admin -Mode On|Off` may change it only for an eligible user.
3. **Non-Admin Denial**: A non-admin request to enable ADMINMODE leaves state unchanged and records an audit denial without interactive output.
4. **Commit Gate and Audit**: Before a CRP containing staged rule paths is committed, the review submission tool MUST enforce ADMINMODE and append the current user, SID, CRP identifier, and affected rule paths to the CM log. Administrator rights do not imply elevation, and elevation does not substitute for ADMINMODE.
