# Walkthrough: CRP-201

## Execution Record

CRP-201 reconciles methodology documentation with the operating boundary between
BCompare visual review and legitimate tracked operational evidence. It does not
define lifecycle state transitions, commit timing, or Control Hub actions.

Updated authoritative documents:

- `docs/Architecture.md`: Added the visual-review scope and operational-evidence
	boundary.
- `docs/Requirements.md`: Added `LCM-REQ-041` for review scope, append-oriented
	operational evidence, and release-closure reconciliation.
- `docs/Implementation.md`: Mapped authoritative methodology, proposal bundles,
	and CM evidence to their distinct responsibilities.
- `docs/LCM-Configuration-Management.md`: Defined operational evidence and
	release-closure reconciliation without redefining lifecycle transitions.

Focused terminology and Markdown validation are pending. A BCompare review of
the `Workspace_AI` documentation changes is required before any commit.
